# Random-Word-Generator
Randomly generates a (theoretically) pronounceable word.

###How to use
There are two arguments: the first is how many letters you'd like it to be. Any number should work.
The second is, if you enter 'exclude', it will allow you to exclude certain letters from being generated in your word.

###This code sucks
Trust me, I know that this code is terrible. I realized a lot of the stuff in it is unnecessary. But screw it, I'm too tired right now to make it pretty.
Or commented. :^)

It Just Werks!
